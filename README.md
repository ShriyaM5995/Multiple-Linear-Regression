1. Linearity: Linear relationship between x and y
2. Homoscedasticity: Equal variance - we dont want see upward or downward cone shaped graph that means that variance is dependent on independent variable.
3. Multivariate Normality: Normality of error distribution- normal distribution of data points
4. Independence: No pattern in data- no autocorrelation between observations/rows
5. Lack of multicollinearity: predictors are not correlated to each other.
6. The outlier check- no significant outliers
